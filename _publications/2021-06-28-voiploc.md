## Abstract

We propose VoIPLoc, a novel location fingerprinting technique and
applyit to the VoIP call provenance problem.It exploits echo-location
information embedded within VoIP audio to support fine-grained
location inference. We found consistent statistical features induced
by the echo-reflection characteristics of the location into recorded
speech. These features are discernible within traces received at the
VoIP destination, enabling location inference. We evaluated VoIPLoc
by developing a dataset of audio traces received through VoIP channels over the Tor network. We show that recording locations can be
fingerprinted and detected remotely with a low false-positive rate,
even when a majority of the audio samples are unlabelled. Finally,
we note that the technique is fully passive and thus undetectable,
unlike prior art. VoIPLoc is robust to the impact of environmental
noise and background sounds, as well as the impact of compressive
codecs and network jitter. The technique is also highly scalable and
offers several degrees of freedom terms of the fingerprintable space.

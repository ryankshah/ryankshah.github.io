excerpt: 'Advertising is a primary means for revenue generation for millions
of websites and smartphone apps. Naturally, a fraction abuse ad networks to systematically defraud advertisers of their money. Modern
defences have matured to overcome some forms of click fraud but
measurement studies have reported that a third of clicks supplied by
ad networks could be clickspam. Our work develops novel inference
techniques which can isolate click fraud attacks using their fundamental properties. We propose two defences, mimicry and bait-click,
which provide clickspam detection with substantially improved results over current approaches. Mimicry leverages the observation
that organic clickfraud involves the reuse of legitimate click traffic, and thus isolates clickspam by detecting patterns of click reuse
within ad network clickstreams. The bait-click defence leverages
the vantage point of an ad network to inject a pattern of bait clicks
into a user’s device. Any organic clickspam generated involving the
bait clicks will be subsequently recognisable by the ad network. Our
experiments show that the mimicry defence detects around 81% of
fake clicks in stealthy (low rate) attacks, with a false-positive rate
of 110 per hundred thousand clicks. Similarly, the bait-click defence
enables further improvements in detection, with rates of 95% and
a reduction in false-positive rates of between 0 and 30 clicks per
million – a substantial improvement over current approaches.'

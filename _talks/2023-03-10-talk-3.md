Abstract: Traditional penetration testing is a proven method for identifying vulnerabilities in computer systems, simulating real-world attacks to identify potential issues before they can be exploited in the real-world. Traditional pentesting makes use of a variety of techniques and tools for organisations, but with the introduction of robotic systems and other cyber-physical systems as a service (e.g. RaaS) becoming more common, will we observe a shift towards more “alternative” styles of pentesting?

I am a highly-skilled individual with strong experience working within time-critical environments. I have co-authored
several research papers, as well as led and collaborated in several industry- and research-related projects. As well as
research, I have also developed and delivered 3 masters-level courses in a new Graduate Apprentice (GA) Masters in
Cybersecurity, as well as delivering several guest lectures at reputable institutions around the United Kingdom and at
current, supervised four MSc students in cybersecurity. At the core, my passion is learning and adapting new
technologies to interesting problems and understanding population needs to develop proactive solutions which benefit
people, society and the environment.

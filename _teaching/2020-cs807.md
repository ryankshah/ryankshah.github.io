CS807 Vulnerability Assessment and Security Testing was a course that made part of the Graduate Apprenticeship MSc in
Cybersecurity, which gave industry professionals the opportunity to achieve a masters degree in cybersecurity while
working at the same time. This course aimed at introducing students to more advanced threat modelling, exploring various
vulnerabilities of different computing systems, and real-world penetration testing and security analysis.

For this course, I helped with the development of lesson plans, content and marking and assessment. The GA programme was
delivered as a series of documents to be read and videos to watch about the content specific to each week. Every 3 weeks (2 in
total for the course) there would be an in-person campus day full of lab sessions and in-person lectures about content
for that week as well. The lab sessions in this course involved Capture-The-Flag (CTF) competitions between students,
thrat modelling assignments and Q&amp;A sessions on class content.

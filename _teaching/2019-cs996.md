CS808 (previously CS996) Computer Security Fundamentals covers a wide variety of topics, including: security fundamentals, threat modelling
and security policies, cryptography, network security and privacy, OS and web security, economics of security and new
topics such as AI, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the cloud.

In this course, I led the content creation for class and exam materials for the new year. As well as this, I was a tutor
who assisted with lab sessions (e.g. experimenting with cryptography tools), delivered three guest lectures (network
security, firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems, security of AI), and assisted with marking and
assessment.

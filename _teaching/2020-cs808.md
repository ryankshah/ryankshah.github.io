CS996 Computer Security Fundamentals covers a wide variety of topics, including: security fundamentals, threat modelling
and security policies, cryptography, network security and privacy, OS and web security, economics of security and new
topics such as AI, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs), Internet-of-Things (IoT) and the cloud.

In this course, I was a tutor who assisted with lab sessions (e.g. experimenting with cryptography tools), delivered
two guest lectures (network security, firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems), and assisted with marking
and assessment.

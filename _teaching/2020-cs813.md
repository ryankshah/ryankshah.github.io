CS813 Advanced Information Security was a course that made part of the Graduate Apprenticeship MSc in Cybersecurity, which
gave industry professionals the opportunity to achieve a masters degree in cybersecurity while working at the same time.
This course covers a wide variety of topics, including: cryptography, Internet security, OSI security, network protocols,
attacks and defences in network security, wireless security, anonymity and machine learning, malware, and web and email
security.

For this course, I led the development of lesson plans, content and marking and assessment. The GA programme was delivered
as a series of documents to be read and videos to watch about the content specific to each week. Every 3 weeks (2 in
total for the course) there would be an in-person campus day full of lab sessions and in-person lectures about content
for that week as well.
